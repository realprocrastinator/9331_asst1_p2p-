This is a simple P2P simulation program using DHT(Distributed Hash Table)

This program is implemented using **Python 3.7.5**, to run the program in Linux or MacOS, you can use command `python3 p2p.py init <peerid> <successor1> <successor2> <ping interval>`  or  `python3 p2p.py init <peerID> <KnownPeerID> <Ping Interval>`

In the interaction mode, you can play around with 3 different commands `><Quit|Request|Store> [File Name]`, here `FileName` should be a four digits integer string in the range of `[0000,9999]`.
